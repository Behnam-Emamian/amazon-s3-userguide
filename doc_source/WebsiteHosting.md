# Hosting a static website using Amazon S3<a name="WebsiteHosting"></a>

You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website\. On a *static* website, individual webpages include static content\. They might also contain client\-side scripts\.

By contrast, a *dynamic* website relies on server\-side processing, including server\-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP\.NET\. Amazon S3 does not support server\-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites\. To learn more about website hosting on AWS, see [Web Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/)\. 

**Note**  
You can use the AWS Amplify Console to host a single page web app\. The AWS Amplify Console supports single page apps built with single page app frameworks \(for example, React JS, Vue JS, Angular JS, and Nuxt\) and static site generators \(for example, Gatsby JS, React\-static, Jekyll, and Hugo\)\. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS Amplify Console User Guide*\.
