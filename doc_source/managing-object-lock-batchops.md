# Managing S3 Object Lock using S3 Batch Operations<a name="managing-object-lock-batchops"></a>

With S3 Object Lock, you can place a legal hold on an object version\. Like setting a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted\. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed\. For more information, see [S3 Object Lock legal hold](batch-ops-legal-hold.md)\.
