# Working with endpoints for your S3 on Outposts<a name="S3OutpostsEndpointsWorking"></a>

To route requests to an Amazon S3 on Outposts access point, you must create and configure an S3 on Outposts endpoint\. Each virtual private cloud \(VPC\) on your Outpost can have one associated endpoint\. For more information about endpoint quotas, see [ S3 on Outposts network requirements](S3OnOutpostsRestrictionsLimitations.md#S3OnOutpostsConnectivityRestrictions)\. You must create these endpoints to be able to access your Outposts buckets and perform object operations\. For more information, see [Endpoints](S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.md#S3OutpostsEP)\.

For more information, see [Working with S3 on Outposts buckets](S3OutpostsWorkingBuckets.md)\.

The following sections describe how to create and manage endpoints\.
